# Flappy Rocket

This is an altered version of the worked clone example for IT-subjects, Flappy Bird. The game is made using Javascript and HTML Canvas.

Flappy Rocket takes place in space with stars, a moon, and occasional shooting stars. The game features a spacerocket, that will fly by tapping the space-button, and can achieve points. The rocket can also die from asteroids or satelites. Watch out.
